# BlackClown : AI-Assisted Tools for Scanning Vulnerability
 Created by Armx888

# Introduction
BLACKCLOWN is an advanced vulnerability scanner that utilizes machine learning models to detect and exploit common security vulnerabilities in web applications. It supports multiple deep learning models and performs automated security assessments.

# Features
   * Supports multiple AI/ML models for vulnerability detection
   * Detects vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, RCE, SSRF, and more
   * Automatically classifies vulnerability types
   * Provides Proof of Concept (PoC) exploitation
   * Supports code analysis from URLs
   * Works with Python and PyTorch

# Installation
# Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

   * Python 3.7+
   * pip
   * PyTorch
   * Transformers
   * Requests
   * Pygments

# Install Dependencies

pip install torch transformers requests pygments

# Usage

# Run the Scanner

python blackclown_scanner.py

# Scan a Target URL

Enter the target URL when prompted:
Enter target URL to scan: https://example.com/api

# Expected Output

   * Detected vulnerabilities with confidence scores
   * Potential exploits attempted
   * Status and response from the target

# Supported Vulnerabilities

   * SQL Injection (SQLi)
   * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   * Command Injection
   * Remote Code Execution (RCE)
   * Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
   * Path Traversal
   * Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
